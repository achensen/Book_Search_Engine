## Additional Notes 
 The initial code for this project was provided by EDX Engineering Services Company to complete an assignment for a Full Stack Web Development Course. My contribution was to complete the code to ensure it had full functionality similar to the mock up that was provided by setting up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API, modifying the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API and creating a Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server. I did receive tutoring assistance to help with my understanding of this assignment, specifically with the routes, especially with deployment, making sure everything was changed over correctly.
